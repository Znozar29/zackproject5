    <h1> Hello I am Zack Nozar</h1>
    <br>
    <h3> Web Developer/Coder In Training</h3>
    <br>
           <p>I am passionate about learning skills that can help me break into the web development field.In todays time, almost everything is driven by technology.This makes it important to learn these things as it helps keep you up to date and in the circle that others are apart of.</p>
      <p>This is my updated landing page that I eventually want to use as part of my professional portfolio. This site at the moment is far from finished as I wish to experiment to see what I can really accomplish when I finish my course with Correlation One. Down below are some memes that I enjoy until I revamp webpage into a website . </p>
